<h2>Brief History</h2>
<p>The game of chess is believed to have originated in 7th century India, existing as a representation of a battle between two factions. The pieces and their unique movements reflected the skillset of various military units: infantry(pawns), cavalry(knights), elephantry(bishops), and chariotry(rooks). In fact, the ancient Indians called the game 'chaturanga', meaning 4 divisions. Through trade and war, the game expanded to Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. For much of its existence, chess would be played by nobles who had the time to partake in leisurely activity. Theory was minimal and it was up to the imagination of the players to create brilliant attacks and sturdy defenses. As such, games in this era were usually quick and decisive skirmishes. The bold, and at times reckless, playing style characteristic of the Romantic era would give birth to modern chess, the game we know today.</p>

<p>Below is a game by my favorite player and the embodiment of Romantic chess: Paul Morphy.</p>
