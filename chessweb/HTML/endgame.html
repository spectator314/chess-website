<h2>Endgame</h2>
<p>The endgame is the phase of the game where most pieces are off the board. This allows the king to enter the fray, as it is no longer in as much danger of being checkmated. The king will become an attacking piece that supports the promotion of passed pawns. Knowing how to successfully navigate this phase is critical to converting promising positions into wins as well as holding seemingly hopeless positions to draws. The key principles of the endgame are to <i>centralize the king</i>, <i>create a passed pawn and support it</i>, and <i>take the opposition</i>. </p>

<div>
	<h3>Centralize the King</h3>
	<figure><img src="../Images/centralizeking.png" alt="centralize king"><figcaption>Centralize the king</figcaption></figure>
	<ul>
		<li><h4>What is centralizing the king?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Bringing the king toward the center of the board</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>Why do we want this?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>In the endgame, most pieces are off the board so the king is in minimal danger and can become an attacking piece</p></li>
			<li><p>The king is essential in promoting our passed pawn(s) and/or defending against the opponent's passed pawn(s) so we want to bring it from the corner of the board to the center where it will have greater effect and range</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>How do we achieve this?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Be mindful of when most pieces are off the board as you will want to centralize the king soon</p></li>
			<li><p>If the opponent is activating the king, it is probably a good idea to match them and begin the race to control the center</p></li>
			<li><p>We will want to move with purpose, so as not to lose any tempo</p></li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

<div>
	<h3>Create a passed pawn and support it</h3>
	<figure><img src="../Images/createpassedpawn.png" alt="create passed pawn"><figcaption>White pushes the a-pawn to create the outside passed pawn</figcaption></figure>
	<ul>
		<li><h4>What is a passed pawn?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>A passed pawn is a pawn that is unopposed by the opponent's pawns, i.e. - there are no enemy pawns in front or on the two files on either side</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>Why do we want this?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>A passed pawn can be promoted into a queen, the most powerful piece in the game</p></li>
			<li><p>A pawn cannot usually deliver checkmate, but a queen can do so rather easily</p></li>
			<li><p>Owing to its grave threat, a passed pawn diverts the opponent's pieces to defensive duties allowing us to attack other pawns</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>How do we achieve this?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Execute pawn breaks that advance a pawn past the opponent's pawns for good</p></li>
				<figure><img src="../Images/supportpassedpawn.png" alt="support passed pawn"><figcaption>Place a rook behind the passed pawn to support its advance</figcaption></figure>
			<li><p>Support the pawn by placing a rook behind it - aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrasch_rule" target="_blank">Tarrasch's rule</a></p></li>
			<li><p>Accordingly, prevent the opponent from creating and supporting passed pawns</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Ice the opponent's pawns with well timed pawn pushes to gummy up the position</p></li>
				<li><p>Place a rook behind opponent's passed pawns as well, so they cannot support it</p></li>
			</ul>
			<li><p>Practice is widely available in the form of books, videos, and puzzles</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>For reading material, I recommend Jeremy Silman's 'Complete Endgame Course'</p></li>
				<li><p>For videos and puzzles, chess.com offers a paid assortment of endgame practice and lectures from top players</a></p></li>

	<h3>Take the opposition</h3>
	<figure><img src="../Images/opposition.png" alt="opposition"><figcaption>White to move is a draw, Black to move is a win for White</figcaption></figure>
	<ul>
		<li><h4>What is the opposition?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>The positioning of our king such that the opponent's king cannot advance</p></li>
			<li><p>The canonical example is when two kings face each other on the same file with one square between them</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>Why do we want this?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Opposition is a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugzwang" target="_blank">zugzwang</a>, where the opponent would rather not have the move</p></li>
			<li><p>Opposition allows us to advance our own passed pawn to promotion or stop the opponent's passed pawn if we are defending</p></li>
			<li><p>Understanding this concept is key to rounding out our endgame skills</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>How do we achieve this?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Move our king to the same file as the opponent's king</p></li>
			<li><p>Naturally, we will want an odd number of squares between our king and the opponent's king, so that we may reach the canonical position</p></li>
			<li><p>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(chess)" target="_blank">triangulation</a> if needed</p></li>
			<li><p>Lichess offers a free basic mini-course on the concept of opposition here: <a href="https://lichess.org/practice/pawn-endgames/opposition/A4ujYOer/eNlmabX1" target="_blank">Opposition</a></p></li>
