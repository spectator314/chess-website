<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>Through the analysis of games played by leading masters and from today's computer engines(e.g. - stockfish), certain themes arise from winning play. A selection of the premier principles include <i>piece activity</i>, <i>center control</i>, and <i>king safety</i>. Of course, there are additional principles/ideas, but these will be written about in more detail in the opening, middlegame, and endgame sections. For now, we can scrape the surface by learning about these general principles that apply to all phases of the game. By following them in our own play, we can hope to improve our chances of victory.</p>

<p>Lastly, it would be criminal not to mention the great Cuban and third world champion, Jose Raul Capablanca, in our study of the chess principles. Perhaps no other player exemplified principled play the way Capablanca did. It is fortunate therefore, that he authored a book 'Chess Fundamentals' that has stood the test of time and is an invaluable resource for study.</p> 

<p>Here is a link to a free online pdf of his book: <a href="https://www.sources.com/SSR/Docs/Capablanca-ChessFundamentals.pdf" target="_blank">Chess Fundamentals</a></p>

<div>
	<h3>Piece Activity</h3>
	<figure><img src="../Images/goodpieceactivity.png" alt="good piece activity" class="good"><figcaption>Good piece placement</figcaption></figure>
	<ul>
		<li><h4>What is piece activity?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Piece activity is the proper placement of your pieces, such that they have freedom of movement</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>Why do we want this?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>By having piece activity, our options for attack and defense greatly increase due to the larger amount of combinations of threats we can create against the opponent</p></li>
			<li><p>In contrast, poor piece activity allows our opponent to attack us freely, because we are not coordinated enough to threaten any counterplay</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>How do we achieve this?</h4></li>
		<figure><img src="../Images/badpieceactivity.png" alt="bad piece activity" class="bad"><figcaption>Poor piece placement</figcaption></figure>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Develop pieces quickly</p></li>
			<li><p>Try not to move the same piece several times in the opening as this fails to bring other attackers and defenders into the game</p></li>
			<li><p>Avoid or break pins and x-ray attacks as these also limit what we can do</p></li>
			<li><p>Bring knights to the center of the board as opposed to the edges to maximize their reach</p></li>
			<li><p>Bring bishops to long diagonals</p></li>
			<li><p>Bring rooks to open files</p></li>
			<li><p>Many gambits involve sacrificing pawns in exchange for rapid development, so avoid being materialistic</p></li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</div>

<div>
	<h3>Center Control</h3>
	<figure><img src="../Images/classical.png" alt="classical approach"><figcaption>Classical</figcaption></figure>
	<ul>
		<li><h4>What is center control?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Center control is the occupation of the central squares of the board, namely d4, d5, e4, e5</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>Why do we want this?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Center control allows our pieces to navigate more freely because we will not be cramped in our own starting position</p></li>
			<li><p>Many times, center control will be the foundation for a strong attack on the opponent's king</p></li>
			<li><p>Central pawns make for excellent outposts for our knights</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>How do we achieve this?</h4></li>
		<figure><img src="../Images/hypermodern.png" alt="hypermodern approach"><figcaption>Hypermodern</figcaption></figure>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Classical approach</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Occupy the center with pawns</p></li>
				<li><p>Support the center pawns with pieces</p></li>
				<li>Recommended for beginners</li>
			</ul>
			<li><p>Hypermodern approach</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Control the center from a distance with pieces</p></li>
				<li><p>Look to undermine the opponent's pawn center with key pawn breaks</p></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</div>

<div>
	<h3>King Safety</h3>
	<figure><img src="../Images/kingsafety.png" alt="king safety"><figcaption>King safety</figcaption></figure>
	<ul>
		<li><h4>What is king safety?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>King safety is the movement of the king to a square that is safe from the opponent's checkmating threats</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>Why do we want this?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>The king is the most important piece in the game, theoretically worth infinite value</p></li>
			<li><p>Getting checkmated results in the immediate loss of the game, which we want to avoid</p></li>
			<li><p>The king is very weak in the opening and middlegame and cannot protect itself well while many pieces remain on the board</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>How do we achieve this?</h4></li>
		<figure><img src="../Images/kingunderattack.png" alt="king under attack"><figcaption>King under attack</figcaption></figure>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Castle early to tuck your king safely into a corner of the board</p></li>
			<li><p>Be mindful when advancing the pawns in front of your castled king, as this creates weaknesses to attack</p></li>
			<li><p>Keep an eye out for any x-ray attacks or discoveries that may attack your king in the future</p></li>
			<li><p>Especially keep an eye out for double check threats, as these cannot be blocked</p></li>
			<li><p>Castling the opposite side as your opponent makes the game a race, so make use of tempo and hurry to attack your opponent's king first</p></li>
			<li><p>Do not overreact to your opponent's pieces getting close to your king if there are no real threats, as you may end up creating weaknesses for your opponent to attack</p></li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

<p>It is important to note that while these principles guide us in proper play, they are not inflexible. While superior piece activity, center control, and king safety will generally give us an advantage against an opponent, there are scenarios where it would be beneficial to break with the principles as the position on the board requires. In the first example below, black has blundered a pawn in the opening. The principles advise us not to move the same piece in the opening and develop others. Yet, the best move would be to capture the pawn. In the second example below, white has the option to castle and tuck his king into the corner, yet doing so would be a fatal blunder.</p>
