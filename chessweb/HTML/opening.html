<h2>Opening</h2>

<p>The opening is the phase of the game where players are still in opening theory/preparation. Openings have been analyzed and played for hundreds, if not thousands, of years and almost always have a name associated with them, e.g. - Italian Game, Queen's Gambit, Caro-Kann. Though many novices believe knowing openings is necessary to play decent chess, this is not truly the case. On the contrary, it is perhaps the least important phase of the game, as one cannot achieve a game winning advantage right from the start(barring a blunder by the opponent). It is advised that novices focus their efforts to improving their endgame and middlegame until they are strong enough to warrant learning openings for slight improvements to their craft.</p>

<p>The principles for the opening are designed to help the player reach a playable middlegame, that is to have a position that is not disadvantageous right from the jump. Oftentimes, openings come from theory and minimal thought has to go into them. An opening specialist might seek to discover their own opening traps or ideas from preparation as well. Nevertheless, for this beginning phase of the game, we will want to <i>develop our pieces</i>, <i>avoid exchanges</i>, and <i>open or close the position</i>.</p>

<div>
	<h3>Develop our pieces</h3>
	<figure><img src="../Images/helpyourpieces.png" alt="help your pieces"><figcaption>White has completed development and launches an attack</figcaption></figure>
	<ul>
		<li><h4>What is developing our pieces?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>To develop our pieces is to place our pieces on active squares in the fight for control of the board</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>Why do we want this?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Developed pieces allow us to attack the opponent because of our piece coordination</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Our pieces are working together fluidly toward the same goal</p></li>
			</ul>
			<li><p>Developed pieces have greater range than undeveloped pieces as we can shift them where they are needed with ease</p></li>
			<li><p>If we complete development before the opponent, we can launch our attack first</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>How do we achieve this?</h4></li>
		<figure><img src="../Images/queenchase.png" alt="queen chase"><figcaption>Black has lost valuable tempo by bringing the queen out early with little to show for it</figcaption></figure>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Get your pieces off their opening squares rapidly</p></li>
			<li><p>Do not be materialistic; you can oftentimes forgo capturing in order to complete development</p></li>
			<li><p>Generally, knights will be developed before bishops</p></li>
			<li><p>Connect rooks on your own backrank</p></li>
			<li><p>Try not to bring the queen out too early because she is the most powerful piece</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>This may sound counterintuitive, but we do not want our queen to be chased around by the opponent's lesser pieces</p></li>
				<li><p>We do not want to exchange her for pawns, knights, bishops, etc. so we would be forced to retreat losing valuable tempo</p></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</div>

<div>
	<h3>Avoid exchanges</h3>
	<figure><img src="../Images/exchange.png" alt="avoid exchanging pieces"><figcaption>Exchanging would only help Black move the bishop to a more active square</figcaption></figure>
	<ul>
		<li><h4>What is avoiding exchanges?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>To avoid exchanges is to not trade off pieces, i.e. - capturing a piece and allowing the opponent to capture back</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>Why do we want this?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Avoiding exchanges is related to piece activity</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>If we develop our pieces, only to exchange them immediately, we do not have developed pieces anymore</p></li>
			</ul>
			<li><p>Keeping pieces on the board allows for a dynamic game, since there are a greater amount of possibilities available to us</p></li>
			<li><p>Oftentimes, when we capture too early, it helps the opponent develop their pieces naturally</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>This gains them valuable tempo and they can launch their attack on us quicker</p></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>How do we achieve this?</h4></li>
		<figure><img src="../Images/bishoppair.png" alt="bishop pair"><figcaption>Bishop pair is a potent weapon</figcaption></figure>
		<ul>
			<li><p>The phrase 'to take is a mistake' holds true especially in the opening</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>It means do not capture unless doing so would achieve some purpose</p></li>
				<li><p>If the capture does not gain material, give us an advantageous position, or trade down into a winning endgame, then there is no point to capturing</p></li>
			</ul>
			<li><p>We do not necessarily need to retreat our pieces if they come under attack</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>If we defend our piece with another piece and the former is captured, we can recapture and then it is the opponent who has lost tempo</p></li>
			</ul>
			<li><p>Especially avoid the temptation to trade off bishops</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>It was once thought that the value of a bishop and knight were equal; worth about 3 pawns</p></li>
				<li><p>Now, we know that bishops are slightly stronger than knights and having the bishop pair on an open board is a formidable advantage</p></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</div>

<div>
	<h3>Open or close the position</h3>
	<figure><img src="../Images/openposition.png" alt="open position"><figcaption>Open position</figcaption></figure>
	<ul>
		<li><h4>What is opening or closing the position?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Opening or closing the position refers to the pawn structure on the board and manipulating it to either free or lock up the position</p></li>
			<li><p>Open positions have pawns that can produce breakthroughs and pieces can flow freely across the board with ease</p></li>
			<li><p>Closed positions have pawns that cannot produce breakthroughs as they are locked in place and pieces will have a difficult time maneuvering around them</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>Why do we want this?</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Players will learn their preference for either open or closed positions and want to guide the game toward their comfort zone</p></li>
			<li><p>If the player knows they are better at a certain type of game and/or the opponent is worse at a type of game, they will want to steer toward their advantage</p></li>
			<li><p>Practically, open games favor bishops while closed games favor knights</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>How do we achieve this?</h4></li>
		<figure><img src="../Images/closedposition.png" alt="closed position"><figcaption>Closed position</figcaption></figure>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Learn your own strengths and weaknesses in either game and understand your preference</p></li>
			<li><p>Identify which pieces you have and which positions would favor them</p></li>
			<li><p>To open a position: </p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Execute pawn breakthroughs and/or piece exchanges that will free up the center of the board</p></li>
				<li><p>Ice an opponent's pawn by placing a piece or pawn in its way and then attack it with another pawn, preventing it from locking up the position</p></li>
				<li><p>Consider sacrificing a piece in exchange for several pawns</p></li>
			</ul>
			<li><p>To close a position: </p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Lock up the position by not allowing pawn breakthroughs or exchanges</p></li>
				<li><p>Make sure your pawns are supported by each other, forming a chain</p></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>
