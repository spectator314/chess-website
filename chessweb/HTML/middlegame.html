<h2>Middlegame</h2>
<p>The middlegame denotes the phase of the game whereby the player has exited opening theory but has not yet reached the endgame where most pieces are off the board. Play in this phase is heavily reliant on tactics, with each move bringing the players ever deeper into a game the universe has yet to witness. It is in this phase that a player may be said to express their playing style. For example, a creative player might sacrifice pieces for strong attacks and play actively, while a positional player might emphasize defense and play quiet safe moves. Unlike the opening and the endgame, there is no exact science to the middlegame. It is up to the imagination and calculation of the player to create something superb. While many games are won in this phase at the lower and intermediate levels, the master level games often reach the endgame. As a player progresses through the ranks, they will learn to keep the endgame in mind while making moves in the middlegame; resulting pawn structure being the most salient example of this.</p>

<p>Below is one of my favorite games, played by arguably the greatest player who ever lived: Robert James Fischer. It was aptly named the 'Game of the Century' and features a multitude of tactical ideas. Enjoy!</p>
